  					<h2>How do the rules work?</h2>
  					<p>
  						It's the responsibility  of the skipper to follow the rules of any race or race series that their boat is competing in. Instructions should be provided by a club for any given race or series, and the club rules should also be made available. Generally, it works in a cascading style. So, if there is no rule for a situation in the sailing instructions, you would defer to the club rules. If there is no rule specified by the club, then you would defer to the Racing Rules of Sailing. The basic rules should be generally understood offhand, and all three of these documents should be onboard the boat for reference.
  						<br>
  						We'll cover the most basic right of way rules here, since they are the most crtical for safety, and since those situations are the ones you will encounter most frequently.

  					<h3>The Racing Rules of Sailing</h3>
  					<p>
  						The Racing Rules of Sailing (RRS) is intended to be a single resource ensuring that the rules of this complex sport are universally understood. The rules are maintained and published by World Sailing, the world governing body of the sport of sailing, recognized by the International Olympic Committee. It is generally reccomended that clubs simply stick to these rules in their sailing programs to help avoid confusion. However, it is common for certain procedures to be modified, such as start sequences.
  						<br>
  						The rules are reviewed and revised every four years.
  						<br>
  						<a href="https://www.racingrulesofsailing.org">racingrulesofsailing.org</a> is a fantastic resource where the rules are available online for free. We also recommend that you keep a printed copy on board. It is available at almost only online bookseller.

  					<h3>What to Know</h3>
  					<p>
  						Before even the basic rules can be covered, there are a few simple terms that must be understood.
  					</p>
  					<table title="Table of some simple sailing terms">
  						<tr>
  							<th>Term</th>
  							<th>Description</th>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Port</td>
  							<td>Left, or left hand side</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Starboard</td>
  							<td>Right, or right hand side</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Port Tack (noun)</td>
  							<td>If a boat is on a port tack, it means that the wind direction is coming from its left side. The sails would be flying on the starboard side.</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Starboard Tack (noun)</td>
  							<td>If a boat is on a starboard tack, it means that the wind direction is coming from its right side. The sails would be flying on the port side.</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Tacking (verb)</td>
  							<td>When a boat changes tacks, it is said to be tacking. The boat's direction will change with respect to the wind and the sails will change sides.</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>To Windward</td>
  							<td>If two boats are near each other, whichever one is closer to the wind direction is the windward boat, or "to windward."</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>To Leeward</td>
  							<td>If two boats are near each other, whichever one is futher from the wind direction is the leeward boat, or "to leeward."</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Overlapped</td>
  							<td>In the context of sail racing, two boats are overlapped if they are on the same tack and any portion of the windward boat sits between the wind and the leeward boat. Otherwise, it is said that there is "no overlap."</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Astern</td>
  							<td>Behind. A boat that is behind another would be called astern.</td>
  						</tr>

  					<h3>Four Simple Right of Way Rules</h3>
  					<p>
  						The four most basic rules regard right of way, and can be found in Part 2 Section A of the RRS. All crew members should be familiar with at least these rules. 
  					</p>
  					<table title="Table of some simple right of way rules">
  						<tr>
  							<th>Rule</th>
  							<th>Description</th>
  							<th>Rule Number</th>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Boats on Different Tacks</td>
  							<td>Boats on a port tack shall keep clear of boats on starboard tack.</td>
  							<td>Rule 10</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Boats on the Same Tack & Overlapped</td>
  							<td>When boats are on the same tack and overlapped, the boat to windward (the boat closest to the wind) shall keep clear of a leeward boat.</td>
  							<td>Rule 11</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>Boats on the Same Tack Not Overlapped</td>
  							<td>When boats are on the same tack and not overlapped, the boat that is astern shall keep clear of the boat ahead.</td>
  							<td>Rule 12</td>
  						</tr>
  						<tr>
  							<td>A Boat That is Tacking</td>
  							<td>When a boat is tacking it shall keep clear of boats that are not tacking.</td>
  							<td>Rule 13</td>
