  					<h2>What is crew work?</h2>
  					<p>
  						Crew work is pretty much everything else. The context of the term here refers to anything crew members have to do to handle maneuvers such as tacks, jibes, sail changes, and any kind of corrective action needed to be performed on the rigging. There are specific roles that you will sometimes hear referring to different members of a crew: Bowman, mastman, pit, to name a few. On larger boats you will sometimes hear them referred to collectively as the foredeck crew. However, on most small to medium boats, everyone will have 3-4 roles depending on point of sail and what maneuver is currently being performed. Unless you are the helmsman you will find yourself doing many of these "crew" activities. 
  						<br>
  						This kind of work is some of the most exciting on the water and, in our opinion, some the most satisfying when done well. We'll cover a general overview of what to expect during maneuvers if you're a novice on board a boat, and how you can be the most helpful with limited knowlege. In additon, we'll give you a taste of the action!

  					<h3>Pay Close Attention</h3>
  					<p>
  						There is a lot of cause and effect onboard a sail boat. That is, pulling on any one given line will have an intended effect, but may also impact other things that are unintended. More experienced crew memebers will often have an expectation of secondary effects and will plan for them. However, even experienced crew should always watch while making adjustments. Sometimes there are unintended concequences due to fouled rigging (a piece of equipment is not configured correctly or has gotten caught on another piece of rigging). Other times, the intended effect is of a greater magnitide than originally expected, such as a spinnaker pole being pulled back too far. 
  						<br>
  						It's easy to see that the theme here is to be actively watching the impacts of what you are doing. This allows you to catch errors and also to manage the magnitude of the intended effect, helping to get a more desireable outcome.

  					<h3>But I'm a novice</h3>
  					<p>
  						It's common for newer team members to be given simple tasks to carry out during complex maneuvers. A novice may not fully understand purpose of the task, so it's important that they pay careful attention to the instructions before the maneuver is performed and ask clarifying questions up front. During the maneuver it's critical to listen for further instructions, as the situation can change quickly. This is as important for crew safety as it is for boat performance. 
  						<br>
  						For example, before a jibe, you may be handed a line and told that you will eventually be called upon to pull on it. The expectation is that you will standby, line in hand, and listen for the order. Explaining what the line does in great detail is probably not practical in the moment, but a good question to ask is "what am I looking at?" In other words, what very basic thing should happen when you pull the line. What should happen, and what shouldn't happen.

  					<h3>What Shouldn't Happen</h3>
  					<p>
  						 Often the things that shouldn't happen are beyond our control. Keeping and eye out and knowing how to handle it is the best we can do. 
  						 <br>
  						 In this example, the crew of Charlie V are doing a sail change. This involves hoisting the genoa, and then doing a takedown on the spinnaker. Joe is "jumping" the halyard (the hoisting line) at the mast, which means he is doing a rapid hoist of the sail. Because of the position of the halyard, he cannot see the sail. The bowman, Jared, can see the sail and so he keeps an eye out. Thankfully he catches the minor tear on the leading edge of the genoa, and so the hoist is stopped before major damage can be done. They then "baby" the sail up and move on to the spinnaker takedown. Overall, this was a successful maneuver, despite the snag.

  					<h3>What Should Happen</h3>
  					<p>
  						 Just for fun, here is a bowman's POV example of a sucessful spinnaker jibe.
  						 <br> 
  						 As you can see, there are a lot of moving parts. A novice will not be placed in the position that the bowman was in this example. But there are plenty of jobs to perform in order to for a jibe to go smoothly. In situations like this, listening and watching are key. Keep your head up, and your ears open.
