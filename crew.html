  					<h2>What is crew work?</h2>
  					<p>
  						Crew work is pretty much everything else. The context of the term here refers to anything crew members have to do to handle maneuvers such as tacks, jibes, sail changes, and any kind of corrective action needed to be performed on the rigging. There are specific roles that you will sometimes hear referring to different members of a crew: Bowman, mastman, pit, to name a few. On larger boats you will sometimes hear them referred to collectively as the foredeck crew. However, on most small to medium boats, everyone will have 3-4 roles depending on point of sail and what maneuver is currently being performed. Unless you are the helmsman you will find yourself doing many of these "crew" activities. 
  						<br>
  						We'll cover a general overview of what to expect during maneuvers if you're a novice on board a boat, and how you can be the most helpful with limited knowlege. In additon, we'll give you a taste of the action.

  					<h3>Pay Close Attention</h3>
  					<p>
  						There is a lot of cause and effect onboard a sail boat. That is, pulling on any one given line will have an intended effect, but may also impact other things that are unintended. More experienced crew memebers will often have an expectation of secondary effects and will plan for them. However, even experienced crew should always watch while making adjustments. Sometimes there are unintended concequences due to fouled rigging (a piece of equipment is not configured correctly or has gotten caught on another piece of rigging). Other times, the intended effect is of a greater magnitide than originally expected. 
  						<br>
  						It's easy to guess that the theme here is to be actively watching the impacts of what you are doing. This allows you to catch errors and also to manage the magnitude of the intended effect, helping to get a more desireable outcome.

  					<h3>Close Hauled Trimming</h3>
  					<p>
  						When getting started trimming a headsail when up wind, it's best to focus on the primary indicator: the telltales or telltails.
  						<br>
  						Almost every job or genoa will come equipped with colored string or tape attached to either side of the sail. In this example, the blue tails are on the outside of the sail and the reds are on the inside.
  						<br>
  						The general goal is to get the tails flying straight back, as in the top example. This indicates that there is an ideal airflow on the inside and outside of the sail.
  						<br>
  						A stalled tail will rise up instead of flying straight back. In the middle example, the inner tail is stalled, and in the bottom example the outer tail is stalled. 
  						<br>
  						The simple rule of thumb is that if the outer tail is stalled, then the sheet needs to be let out, and if the inner tail is stalled, the sheet needs to be trimmed in. However, with upwind sailing, it is always possible that you are sailing "too close" to the wind. If this is the case, the driver will need to steer the boat further off of the wind, instead of trimming the sail in.

  					<h3>Great, what's next?</h3>
  					<p>
  						There is so much more to trimming than this. For starters, there are many other factors when trimming a jib for best performance. Overall shape of the sail is considered, and all kinds of adjustments are made to influence this. That's just for the one kind of sail. There are different sails, such as the mainsail, and headsails used at different points of sail than a jib or genoa.
  						<br>
  						The absolute best way to learn is to get out there armed with this basic knowlege and to pay close attention to your sails, and to the advice and instructions from the experienced crew members. There's always lots to learn.
