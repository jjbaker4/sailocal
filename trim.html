  					<h2>What is trimming?</h2>
  					<p>
  						Simply put, trimming is the act of adjusting the position and shape of your sails for optimum performance at your given point of sail. This is routinely done using a primary control line called a sheet, which every type of sail uses. There are other adjustments that can be made depending on the sail. These include outhauls and vangs for main sails, aftguys and foreguys for symmetrical spinnakers, tack lines for asymmetric spinnakers, and many more. However, a beginner should not worry about those. The best way to get started is with a basic understanding of sail position, sail shape, and how to use a sheet to manage them.
  						<br>
  						As an introduction, we'll cover simple points of sail, and upwind headsail trimming. This is otherwise known as trimming the jib, or genoa.

  					<h3>Point of Sail</h3>
  					<p>
  						A fundamental understanding of point-of-sail is critical before one can begin learning how to trim the sails. The major points of sail include a beat (close hauled), a reach, and a run. The diagram elaborates on this by illustrating that there is more than one kind of reach. In addition, there is a dead area. Suffice to say, you cannot sail directly into the wind. The size of the dead area varies by boat, and competent sail trimming can help reduce this zone. 
  						<br>
  						In the figure, you can see the various sail positions for each point of sail. When close hauled the sails are pulled in closer to the center of the boat, and when running the sails are pushed out far from the center of the boat. It's easy to imagine why this makes sense.

  					<h3>Close Hauled Trimming</h3>
  					<p>
  						When getting started trimming a headsail when up wind, it's best to focus on the primary indicator: the telltales or telltails.
  						<br>
  						Almost every job or genoa will come equipped with colored string or tape attached to either side of the sail. In this example, the blue tails are on the outside of the sail and the reds are on the inside.
  						<br>
  						The general goal is to get the tails flying straight back, as in the top example. This indicates that there is an ideal airflow on the inside and outside of the sail.
  						<br>
  						A stalled tail will rise up instead of flying straight back. In the middle example, the inner tail is stalled, and in the bottom example the outer tail is stalled. 
  						<br>
  						The simple rule of thumb is that if the outer tail is stalled, then the sheet needs to be let out, and if the inner tail is stalled, the sheet needs to be trimmed in. However, with upwind sailing, it is always possible that you are sailing "too close" to the wind. If this is the case, the driver will need to steer the boat further off of the wind, instead of trimming the sail in.

  					<h3>Great, what's next?</h3>
  					<p>
  						There is so much more to trimming than this. For starters, there are many other factors when trimming a jib for best performance. Overall shape of the sail is considered, and all kinds of adjustments are made to influence this. That's just for the one kind of sail. There are different sails, such as the mainsail, and headsails used at different points of sail than a jib or genoa.
  						<br>
  						The absolute best way to learn is to get out there armed with this basic knowlege and to pay close attention to your sails, and to the advice and instructions from the experienced crew members. There's always lots to learn.
