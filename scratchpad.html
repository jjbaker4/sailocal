  		It's common for newer team members to be given simple tasks to carry out during complex maneuvers. A novice may not fully understand purpose of the task, so it's important that they pay careful attention to the instructions before the maneuver is performed, and ask clarifying questions up front. During the maneuver it's critical to listen for further instructions, as the situation can change quickly. This is as important for crew safety as it is for boat performance.

  		For example, before a jibe, you may be handed a line and told that will eventually be called upon to pull on it. The expectation is that you will standby, line in hand, and listen for the order. Explaining what the line does in great detail is probably not practical in the moment, but a good question to ask is "what am I looking at?"
